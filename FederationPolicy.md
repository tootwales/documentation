# Federation Policy

_(Fersiwn Cymraeg ddim ar gael eto. Cysylltwch â staff os hoffech chi helpu i gyfieithu)_

Tŵt Cymru | Toot Wales ("Tŵt") interconnects various services using the ActivityPub standard. ActivityPub provides two layers; a server to server federation protocol so decentralized websites can share information, and a client to server protocol so real-world users, bots, and other automated processes can communicate with ActivityPub using their accounts on servers.

Tŵt curates the servers with which it federates. As such, toot.wales endeavours to provide a moderate, friendly channel for people to use for all manner of topics and conversations, while observing the general etiquette of being in a public space.

Servers, and service providers, that stand in direct contrast to toot.wales’ published Code of Conduct are subject to limitation of deliverability on the toot.wales network.

Limitations are, in ascending order of severity: 

* **Reject Media** \
No files from the remote server will be processed locally. That includes avatars, headers, emojis and media attachments. Accounts can be found and followed. Messages will still be delivered.
* **Silence** \
All past and future accounts from the remote server are silenced and will not be visible in public timelines, but can be found and followed. Followed accounts will show up in the home timeline of the member following those accounts.
* **Suspend** \
All past and future accounts from the server are disconnected and undeliverable. No content from the remote server will be stored locally except for usernames.

A server that consistently delivers untagged nudity, gore, imagery and video that is required to be tagged according to our Code of Conduct, will be set to Reject Media. Accounts on that server can still be found and followed.

A server that consistently fails to moderate their general membership and can be demonstrated to host individual accounts that would contravene our Code of Conduct may be silenced.

A server that consistently fails to moderate their general membership and can be demonstrated to host a preponderance of accounts that would contravene our Code of Conduct will be silenced. Accounts can be found and followed, although individual accounts will be Suspended.

A server that willingly, knowingly hosts members that publicly and repeatedly exhibit hate, discrimination and/or harrassment will be Suspended. No accounts can be found or followed, no messages will be delivered.

A server that willingly, knowingly hosts members that publicly and repeatedly allow content illegal in the United Kingdom, the European Union and its member states, or the United States of America will be Suspended. No accounts can be found or followed, no messages will be delivered.

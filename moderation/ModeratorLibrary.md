The following documents are considered guiding documents and can provide context and education on content moderation in general.

## Human Rights
> Regardless of the problem being addressed by content moderation, removal of an online post is a limitation of a user’s freedom of expression, so this also needs to be done in a way which is predictable, legitimate, necessary and proportionate

> To minimise the risk of hasty, ineffective, counterproductive or disproportionate responses to newly arising challenges, (moderators) should aim to develop a clear, public methodology for categorising different types of content and developing adequate and human rights compliant responses. Such a public methodology should be made available by (...) online platforms in a transparent and easily accessible manner.

As a communications service provider, our membership is entitled to freedom of expression subject to our rules pursuant to various declartions of human rights.
